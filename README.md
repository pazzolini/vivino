# Portuguese Wine Through the Lenses of Vivino's Users

## Overview

This repository contains the second practical assignment for **Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science 2022/23**. This project explores Portuguese wines using data collected from Vivino. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and classification using machine learning models to predict wine ratings based on different features.

## Files Included 

### Jupyter Notebook

- ðŸ“Œ File: Portuguese_Wine.ipynb
- ðŸŽ® Description: A Jupyter Notebook that covers data exploration, enrichment, and supervised classification of Portuguese wines based on data gathered from Vivino.
- ðŸ”§ Main Tasks:
	- Data cleaning and pre-processing
	- Data analysis and feature engineering
	- Supervised classification using different machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNeighbors Classifier)

### Datasets

- ðŸ“Œ Files:
	- pt_wine_merged.csv: Cleaned and merged dataset containing 3281 Portuguese wine references.
	- classification_data.csv: Dataset used for classification tasks with wine features (Winery, Year, Type, Price, Number of Reviews, Region).

- ðŸ“Œ Raw Datasets:
	- The raw datasets (referenced in the Checkpoint section of the project) are also included in the folder.
